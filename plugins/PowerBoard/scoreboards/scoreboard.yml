# Here you can customize the scoreboard.
# You can add as many animation steps as you like.
#
# For every score (row) you can set a different speed.
# You can use up to 14 rows. To add a new row, just add a new number like this: '7':
# But to prevent issues, you can also copy & paste the last row for example and then modify the text.
#
# Note: For static lines (no animations or updates needed): Set the 'speed' value to '-1'. This will save performance.
# Note: You need to specify the speed in ticks, not seconds: 20 ticks = one second.
# Note: The speed value can not be higher than 9999.
